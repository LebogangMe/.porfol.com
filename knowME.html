        SYSTEM PROPOSAL NAME  
        
        IFindTaxi System. 
        
        <h1>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h1>
        <p></p>The current situation is that when people want to go somewhere they need transport, most people use taxis. The issue is normally overload, change when people have paid and time waisted when the driver takes different routes searching for other people. 
        Each request made with a smart device leads to an early transport, correct route at the right time and no payment issues.</p> 
        
        
        <h1>OBECTIVE USERS OF THE SYSTEM 
        
        
        IFindTaxi System is a project is aimed at assisting passengers with finding taxi ranks and taxis to their respective desired destination. With just the click of finger any individual can access the software before they can travel to find the nearest taxi rank to wherever they want to go, prices are even displayed in respective of where one want to travel to. Firstly, a passenger will through the software in a taxi rank search to wherever they want to go after finding the nearest taxi rank to an extent of finding where the taxi is located inside the taxi rank line, and they can even pay through the software. It includes taxi drivers too as they play a role of registering their taxi credentials in the system and activating a taxi when it is their turn to commute passengers, so that a passenger can see an active taxi inside the IFindTaxi software as explained above. The primary objective of is for a IFindTaxi passenger to identify the spot of their destination where they want to be dropped off in line with a registered route taxis uses regularly, because in most cases people struggle with drop off spot due to communication misunderstandings of a taxi driver and a passenger.
